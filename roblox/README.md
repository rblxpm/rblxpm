# RBLXPM
RBLXPM, Roblox Package Manager, is a new package manager for the Roblox platform. It has two major builds: cli and roblox. The CLI is more powerful and is meant for use with tools like Rojo. The Roblox tool is used in Lua code in studio to import modules.
# Release
Roblox Package Manager is entirely experimental, and, as such, it does not have a set release date, release map, or any guarantee of completion.
